Q: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
A: Based on the work I've done in this lab, graceful degradation and service workers are very closely related in the functionality they both aim to deliver. Graceful degradation starts from the code, and then addresses lower levels with grace. Similarly, service workers begin with a fully functioning website, and then are integrated to provide offline abilities for users with low/no network accessibility. This aligns very well with the fact that graceful degradation is better for web-apps, and improves the resilience (as it can perform in offline conditions), performance (optimizes performance to utilize network whenever available, reducing dependence on it), and a11y (more users are able to be reached due to the increased network capabilities) of the product delivered.
